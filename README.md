# Derick the Zebra
He is single and loves to fight rhinos
Derick's best friend is Babu, the Baboon. They grew up together in Lower Zambezi.
Babu met Derick in the Lower Zambezi. Babu remembers the day like it was yesterday, it was a bright sunny day two days before Christmas of that year. His entire family was preoccupied with looking for Christmas presents to surprise him with, which was quite understandable as this was the first Christmas Babu was aware of. Babu was determined to also find something special to surprise his family with, especially for his two sister's whom he adored. As he wandered around looking for something, he heard the sound of someone singing "I am a little zebra white and black with a bushy mane running down my back. I like to gallop, run and play out on the Lower Zambezi Plains". Babu could not help but laugh hysterically at the sight of a zebra dancing and singing, it was especially funny because the zebra had a terrible singing voice.
