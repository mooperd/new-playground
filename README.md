# Derick the Zebra
He is single and loves to fight rhinos
Derick's best friend is Babu, the Baboon. They grew up together in Lower Zambezi.
Babu and Derick have been best friends since they were were two. Derick has always been the naughty one and always getting both of them in trouble. He however is a very realiable friend and is a good listener. Growing up was always fun for both friends.
