# Derick the Zebra
He is single and loves to fight chimps.
Derick's best friend is Babu, the Baboon. They grew up together in Lower Zambezi.
Babu and Derick have been best friends since they were two years old. Derick has always been the naughty one and always getting both of them in trouble. He however, is a very realiable friend and a good listener. Growing up was always fun for both friends.
Babu's parents and his two older sisters Babette and Buffy moved to Lower Zambezi shortly before Babu's birth. They used to stay at the Lake Kariba, but eventually decided to move further up the river as they heard that fruits would taste much sweeter over there. Babu does not particularly like fruits. He prefers crops and roots. In contrast to Derick, he is more cautious and timid. He often wonders how Derick always manages to get them into trouble.
